        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document</p>
        <p>written in a markup language like HTML.</p>
        <p>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript</p>
        <p>[2]CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p>
        <p>[3] This separation can improve content accessibility,</p>
        <p>rovide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,</p>
        <p>enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .</p>
        <p>css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
        <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different</p>
        <p>styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),</p>
        <p>and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
